            <p class = "biographytext"><b>Stefan Corbin Burnett</b>, better known by his stage name MC Ride, is an American rapper, songwriter, and visual artist. Stefan Corbin Burnett was <i>allegedly</i> born on May 10, 1978 in Sacramento, California to Naomi and Errol Burnett. He is the frontman of experimental hip hop group <b>Death Grips</b>. He began his career in the late 1990s as Mxlplx or Bruce Jelly. He also performed with his brother Isaac Burnett who was under the alias "Swank Daddy". In 2010, Burnett took on the name "Ride" and formed Death Grips with his next door neighbor, Zach Hill, who was known for his drumming work with the band Hella and his session work. Hill soon brought friend and producer Andy Morin into the group, and they began working together. Burnett has garnered attention for his aggressive rapping style and cryptic lyrics. His vocal delivery has been described as "(a) visceral and poetic form of rapping, resembling a blend of hardcore punk and spoken word performance". His style was also described as "paint-peeling barks and startling yelps". Stefan Burnett has been described as "reclusive" and "super private" by his bandmate Zach Hill. </p>

            <q>I'm a very private person, I have very few people that I call my friends. I'm very distrustful of human beings in general; I'm very distrustful of media. I have no interest in sharing my personal life with the world. Zero.</q>
